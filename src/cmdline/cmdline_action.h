/** \brief Apply the given command-line action to the given package,
 *  updating the command-line state appropriately.
 *
 *  \param action The action to apply to the package.
 *
 *  \param pkg The package whose state is to be modified.
 *
 *  \param seen_virtual_packages The set of pure virtual packages that
 *         have already been "seen".  If pkg is a pure virtual package
 *         in this set, it will not be ignored even if a provider is
 *         already installed or going to be installed.  If only one
 *         package provides pkg, that package will be targeted by the
 *         action; otherwise cmdline_applyaction will fail but not
 *         print the usual error message.  The purpose of this option
 *         is to improve the error messages that are printed on the
 *         second pass, but more importantly to ensure that the
 *         dependencies of virtual packages are installed. (bug #475006)
 *
 *  \param to_install The set of packages that are currently marked
 *  to-be-installed; will be updated in accordance with the selected
 *  action.
 *
 *  \param to_hold The set of packages that are currently marked
 *  to-be-held; will be updated in accordance with the selected
 *  action.
 *
 *  \param to_remove The set of packages that are currently marked
 *  to-be-removed; will be updated in accordance with the selected
 *  action.
 *
 *  \param to_purge The set of packages that are currently marked
 *  to-be-purged; will be updated in accordance with the selected
 *  action.
 *
 *  \param verbose The verbosity level at which this command should
 *  operate.
 *
 *  \param source The version-source to be used for this package.
 *
 *  \param sourcestr The string associated with the version source, or
 *  "" if there is no associated string.
 *
 *  \param policy A current policy object (passed as a parameter to
 *  avoid creating a separate one for each action).
 *
 *  \param arch_only If \b true, when packages' build-depends are
 *  satisfied, only architecture-dependent build depends are used;
 *  Build-Depends-Indep and Build-Conflicts-Indep lines are ignored.
 *
 *  \param allow_auto If \b false, auto-installation of dependencies
 *  will be disabled regardless of the value of Auto-Install.
