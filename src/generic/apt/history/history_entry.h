     *
     *  History entries use some common concepts:
     *
     *   - aptitude state: the current extended aptitude state of a
     *     package.  This consists of several components: the
     *     selection state, the chosen candidate version (if any), the
     *     forbidden version (if any), the reason the package was
     *     marked for removal if it's being removed, whether the
     *     package is flagged for upgrade, and whether the package is
     *     being reinstalled.
     *
     *     User tags are deliberately omitted: they are conceptually
     *     different from the state information, and repeating them
     *     all the time would take up a lot of space if they were used
     *     much.
     *
     *     aptitude states are serialized like this:
     *
     *       selection-state =CANDVER !FORBIDVER
     *
     *     where selection-state is "install", "upgrade", "reinstall",
     *     "delete", "purge", "keep", or "hold", CANDVER is the
     *     selected candidate version number (missing if none) and
     *     FORBIDVER is the forbidden version number (missing if
     *     none).  If the selection-state is "purge" or "delete", the
     *     next word will be either "manual", "libapt",
     *     "from-resolver", or "unused".  Note that we could infer the
     *     *new* remove reason from the type of change being made, but
     *     not the old one.
     *
     *   - Dpkg selected state: the "future state" recorded by
     *     dselect.  One of "unknown", "install", "hold", "deinstall",
     *     and "purge".  We detect changes here by recording the last
     *     seen state in /var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates.
     *
     *   - Dpkg current state: the current status of this package in
     *     the dpkg database.  One of "notinstalled", "unpacked",
     *     "halfconfigured", "halfinstalled", "configfiles",
     *     "installed", "triggersawaited", and "triggerspending".  All
     *     states except "notinstalled" have an attached version.  We
     *     detect changes by recording the last seen state in
     *     /var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates.
     *
     *  \todo Changes to the "auto" flag between aptitude runs won't
     *  be picked up with this system because we don't know the
     *  last-seen value.  Perhaps that should be stored in the
