/** \brief Glue code to make the resolver talk to the core aptitude classes.
 *
 *  
 *  General comment on how the iterators are handled: basically the
 *  technique is (generally) to have a normalize() routine that
 *  advances the current iterator(s) to the next "interesting"
 *  iterator.  For instance, broken_dep_iterator::normalize() moves to
 *  the next broken dependency (sort of).  If the current iterator is
 *  already interesting, nothing happens.  This is used on
 *  initialization and in operator++ (after advancing the iterator a
 *  single step manually).
