/** \defgroup problemresolver Aptitude's problem resolver
 *
 *  \section Overview
 *
 *  This is a replacement for the standard apt problem resolver.  It
 *  uses a different algorithm which, while it is less efficient,
 *  allows the program to have more direct control over the results,
 *  allows the user to pick and choose from multiple solutions, and
 *  can produce a more user-friendly explanation of its actions.
 *
 *  The problem resolver class is templated on abstract packages.
 *  Normally this will be the system of apt packages described by
 *  aptitude_universe, but for the purpose of testing the algorithm a
 *  simpler package system, the dummy_universe, is used.
 *
 *  Each package version has an associated "score" which indicates,
 *  essentially, how hard the problem resolver will try to keep it on
 *  the system (or, for negative scores, to remove it from the
 *  system).  The sum of all installed package's scores is used as a
 *  heuristic in a directed search of the solution space.
 *
 *  \sa \subpage abstract_universe, generic_problem_resolver
 *
 *  \page abstract_universe The abstract package universe interface
 *
 *  The package universe interface consists of the following
 *  interrelated Concepts (see the <A
 *  HREF="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stl_introduction.html">STL
 *  documentation</A> for a definition of what a Concept is):
 *
 *  - \subpage universe_universe
 *  - \subpage universe_package
 *  - \subpage universe_version
 *  - \subpage universe_dep
 *  - \subpage universe_installation
 *
 *  Note that in order to allow APT structures to be wrapped with
 *  minimal overhead, all iterators in this section are "APT-style"
 *  iterators: instead of calculating container bounds by invoking an
 *  "end" method on the container, each iterator has a predicate
 *  method end() which returns \b true if the iterator is an "end"
 *  iterator.
 *
 *  \sa \ref problemresolver
 *
 *  \page universe_universe Universe concept
 *
 *  The package universe is the base type representing a domain of
 *  package relationships.  It contains classes representing the
 *  various objects in the domain, along with methods to retrieve
 *  information about the number of entities in the universe and to
 *  iterate over global lists of entities.
 *
 *  aptitude_universe and dummy_universe are models of the generic
 *  universe concept.
 *
 *  \sa \ref universe_package, \ref universe_version, \ref universe_dep
 *
 *  A class modelling the Universe concept should provide the
 *  following members:
 *
 *  - <b>package</b>: a model of \ref universe_package "the Package concept".
 *
 *  - <b>version</b>: a model of \ref universe_version "the Version concept".
 *
 *  - <b>dep</b>: a model of \ref universe_dep "the Dependency concept".
 *
 *  - <b>package_iterator</b>: an iterator over the list of all the
 *  \ref universe_package "package"s in this universe.
 *
 *  - <b>dep_iterator</b>: an iterator over the list of all the \ref
 *  universe_dep "dependencies" in this universe.
 *
 *  - <b>get_package_count()</b>: returns the number of \ref
 *  universe_package "package"s in the universe.
 *
 *  - <b>get_version_count()</b>: returns the number of \ref
 *  universe_version "version"s in the universe.
 *
 *  - <b>packages_begin()</b>: returns a <b>package_iterator</b>
 *  pointing at the first \ref universe_package "package" (in an
 *  arbitrary ordering) in the universe.
 *
 *  - <b>deps_begin()</b>: returns a \b dep_iterator pointing at the
 *  first \ref universe_dep "dependency" (in an arbitrary ordering) in
 *  the universe.
 *
 *  - <b>bool is_candidate_for_initial_set(const dep &)</b>: returns
 *    \b true if the dependency should be in the set of dependencies
 *    the resolver initially sets out to solve.  Dependencies for
 *    which this returns "false" will not be deliberately solved
 *    (although they might be coincidentally solved by other changes
 *    the resolver makes).  This is a member of the universe and not
 *    the dependency concept because I forsee the program possibly
 *    wanting to create universes with different behavior in this
 *    regard at some point in the future.
 *
 *
 *  \page universe_package Package concept
 *
 *  A package is simply a unique collection of \ref universe_version
 *  "versions".  No two packages in the same universe may share
 *  versions, and \e exactly one version of a package is installed at
 *  any given time.  A package has a "currently installed version",
 *  which is the version that should be included in the starting point
 *  of a solution search.
 *
 *  \sa \ref universe_universe, \ref universe_version, \ref universe_dep
 *
 *  A class modelling the Package concept should provide the following
 *  members:
 *
 *  - <b>version_iterator</b>: an iterator over the list of \ref
 *  universe_version "versions" of a package.
 *
 *  - <b>get_name()</b>: returns a string that uniquely names this
 *  package.  This may be used for debugging output or when dumping a
 *  portable representation of a dependency problem.
 *
 *  - <b>get_id()</b>: returns an integer between 0 and
 *  U.get_package_count()-1 (where U is the \ref universe_universe
 *  "universe" to which the package belongs) that uniquely identifies
 *  this package in U.
 *
 *  - <b>bool operator==(package)</b>, <b>operator!=(package)</b>:
 *  compare packages by identity.  Two package objects compare equal
 *  if and only if they represent the same package.
 *
 *  - <b>bool operator<(package)</b>: an arbitrary total ordering on
 *  packages.  This should be appropriate for, eg, placing packages
 *  into a balanced tree structure.
 *
 *  - \anchor universe_package_current_version
 *  <b>current_version()</b>: returns the "currently installed \ref
 *  universe_version "version"" of the package.  For instance, the
 *  apt_universe class considers the InstVersion of a package to be
 *  its "current version".
 *
 *  - <b>versions_begin()</b>: returns a version_iterator pointing to
 *  the head of the list of versions of this package, provided in an
 *  arbitrary order.
 *
 *  \page universe_version Version concept
 *
 *  A version is simply a particular variant of a package that may be
 *  installed.  When the abstract package system is modelling a
 *  concrete universe (such as the APT universe), versions typically
 *  correspond either to a real version of the package, or to the
 *  package's removal.
 *
 *  Each version contains a link to its parent package, as well as
 *  lists of forward and reverse dependencies.
 *
 *  \sa \ref universe_universe, \ref universe_package, \ref universe_dep
 *
 *  A class modelling the Version concept should provide the following
 *  members:
 *
 *  - <b>dep_iterator</b>: an iterator class for forward dependencies.
 *
 *  - <b>revdep_iterator</b>: an iterator class for reverse dependencies.
 *
 *  - <b>get_name()</b>: returns a string that uniquely identifies
 *  this version among all the versions of the same package.
 *
 *  - <b>get_id()</b>: returns a number between 0 and
 *  U.get_version_count()-1 (where U is the \ref universe_universe
 *  "universe" to which this version belongs) uniquely identifying
 *  this version.
 *
 *  - <b>package get_package()</b>: returns the \ref universe_package
 *  "package" of which this is a version.
 *
 *  - <b>dep_iterator deps_begin()</b>: returns a \b dep_iterator
 *  pointing to the first \ref universe_dep "dependency" in the list
 *  of forward dependencies.
 *
 *  - <b>revdep_iterator revdeps_begin()</b>: returns a \b
 *  revdep_iterator pointing to the first \ref universe_dep
 *  "dependency" in the list of reverse dependencies.
 *
 *    \note Although it would be straightforward to define the reverse
 *    dependencies of a version as the set of dependencies that
 *    impinge on that version, they are \e not defined in this manner.
 *    For technical reasons and in order to keep the wrapper to the
 *    APT package system thin, the reverse dependencies are only
 *    required to obey the following rule: if \e v1 and \e v2 are
 *    versions of the same \ref universe_package "package", then for
 *    any \ref universe_dep "dependency" \e d such that \e v1 is a
 *    target of \e d and \e v2 is not, or vice versa, \e d appears in
 *    \e either the reverse dependency list of \e v1 or the reverse
 *    dependency list of \e v2.
 *
 *  - <b>operator==(version)</b>, <b>operator!=(version)</b>:
 *  compare versions by identity.  Two version objects compare equal
 *  if and only if they represent the same version of the same
 *  package.
 *
 *  - <b>operator<(version)</b>: an arbitrary total ordering on
 *  versions.  This should be appropriate for, eg, placing versions
 *  into a balanced tree structure.
 *
 *  \page universe_dep Dependency concept
 *
 *  A dependency indicates that if a particular \ref universe_version
 *  "version" is installed, at least one member of a set of \ref
 *  universe_version "version"s must also be installed.  The first
 *  \ref universe_version "version" is the "source" of the dependency,
 *  while the remaining versions are "solvers" of the dependency.  A
 *  dependency may be "soft", indicating that it is legal (but
 *  undesirable) for the dependency to remain broken at the end of a
 *  solution search.
 *
 *  \todo "solvers" should be renamed to "targets", as a dependency
 *  can also be resolved by removing its source.
 *
 *  \sa \ref universe_universe, \ref universe_package, \ref
 *  universe_version, \ref universe_installation
 *
 *  A class modelling the Dependency concept should provide the
 *  following members:
 *
 *  - <b>solver_iterator</b>: an iterator over the versions that are
 *  targets of this dependency.
 *
 *  - <b>version get_source()</b>: returns the source \ref
 *  universe_version "version" of this dependency.
 *
 *  - <b>solver_iterator solvers_begin()</b>: returns a
 *  solver_iterator pointing to the first target of this dependency.
 *
 *  - <b>bool is_soft()</b>: returns \b true if the dependency is "soft".
 *  For instance, in the Debian package system, a Recommends
 *  relationship is considered to be a soft dependency.
 *
 *  - <b>bool solved_by(version)</b>: return \b true if the given \ref
 *  universe_version "version" solves this dependency, either by
 *  removing the source of the dependency or by installing one of its
 *  targets.
 *
 *  - <b>template &lt;typename Installation&gt; bool broken_under(Installation)</b>: return \b true if this dependency
 *  is broken by the given \ref universe_installation "installation";
 *  a solution breaks a dependency if and only if it installs the
 *  dependency's source and none of its targets.
 *
 *  - <b>operator==(dependency)</b>, <b>operator!=(dependency)</b>:
 *  compare dependencies by identity.  Two dependency objects compare
 *  equal if and only if they represent the same dependency.
 *  Duplicated dependencies may compare as distinct entities.
 *
 *  - <b>operator<(dependency)</b>: an arbitrary total ordering on
 *  dependencies.  This should be appropriate for, eg, placing
 *  dependencies into a balanced tree structure.
 *
 *  \page universe_installation Installation concept
 *
 *  An Installation represents a potential state of an abstract
 *  dependency system; that is, a set of installed versions (or
 *  rather, a total function from packages to versions).
 *
 *  The generic_solution class is a model of the Installation concept.
 *
 *  \sa \ref abstract_universe
 *
 *  A class modelling the Installation concept should provide the
 *  following members:
 *
 *  - <b>version version_of(package)</b>: look up the currently
 *  installed \ref universe_version "version" of the given \ref
 *  universe_package "package" according to this installation.

/** \brief A generic package problem resolver.
 *
 *  \param PackageUniverse A model of the \ref universe_universe
 *  Universe concept.
 *
 *  Searches from the starting node on a best-first basis; i.e., it
 *  repeatedly pulls the "best" node off its work queue, returns it if
 *  it is a solution, and enqueues its successors if not.  The
 *  successor nodes to a given search node are generated by selecting
 *  a single dependency that is broken at that node and enqueuing all
 *  possibly ways of fixing it.  The score of a node is affected by:
 *
 *  - A penalty/bonus applied to each package version.
 *
 *  - A bonus for each step of the solution (used to discourage the
 *  resolver from "backing up" unnecessarily).
 *
 *  - A penalty is added for each broken dependency that has not yet
 *  been processed.  This aims at directing the search towards "less
 *  broken" situations.
 *
 *  - A penalty for soft dependencies (i.e., Recommends) which were
 *  processed and left broken.
 *
 *  - A bonus for nodes that have no unprocessed broken dependencies.
 *
 *  Note that these are simply the default biases set by aptitude; any
 *  of these scores may be changed at will (including changing a
 *  penalty to a bonus or vice versa!).
