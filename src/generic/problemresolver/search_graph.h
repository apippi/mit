  // since aptitude has a flexible search order, the children might be
  // run after we've "finished" processing the parent step.  So it's
  // necessary to somehow store all the steps with children that are
  // pending evaluation.
  //
  // Actually, *all* steps are stored, not just ones with pending
  // children: this lets us handle situations where promotions are
  // generated more than once for the same step (for instance, if a
  // step eventually ends up at cost 40,000 but has one child that
  // passes through cost 30,000, it will first be promoted to cost
  // 30,000, then later to cost 40,000).
  //
  // The lifetime of a step is as follows:
  //  (1) Created with no children, an initial intrinsic promotion,
  //      and maybe a parent link.
  //  (2) Children added, along with successor constraints.
  //  (3) When each of its children has registered a promotion,
  //      the step's promotion is set and its parent is examined
  //      to see if it should get a promotion now.
  //
  // Regarding (3), what we do is this: whenever a new promotion is
  // computed for a step, it goes into the set of promotions for that
  // step and onto the list of promotions if it was really new.  Then,
  // we add the parent to a set of nodes that should be examined for
  // promotion propagation.  After the step finishes, the nodes in
  // this set are processed for propagation from their children.
  //
  // To save space and keep things compact, the tree is represented as
  // an array (actually a deque), with parent and child links stored
  // as indices into the array.  This made more sense when it had just
  // a few members; maybe now it should be allocated on the heap and
