/** \brief Represents the value of a single component of a solution's
 *  cost.
 *
 *  A cost is an ordered sequence of levels.  Levels are integers that
 *  can be modified either by being incremented or by being increased
 *  to be at least the given value.  However, a given slot in a cost
 *  object can only be modified in one of these ways; for instance, a
 *  slot that is the result of an increment can't later be raised to a
 *  minimum value.
 *
 *  The reason for representing levels this way is that it allows the
 *  resolver to support both "increase the cost to X" and "add X to
 *  the cost" operations in a sound manner; in particular, this way
 *  those two operations are both associative and commutative.  (in
 *  this case, they are associative and commutative in the sense that
 *  applying both types of operations always errors out)
 *
 *  Note: the "increase cost to X" operation is important for
 *  respecting priorities (there doesn't seem to be an obvious
 *  alternative there), for backwards-compatibility, and so that the
 *  resolver can easily become non-optimizing if necessary (e.g., if
 *  the optimizing version experiences too many performance problems,
 *  reverting to the old behavior is a simple change to the default
 *  settings).
 *
 *  Note that levels can represent both a cost entry, or a *change* to
 *  a cost entry.  The "combine" method will either merge two changes
 *  into a single change, or apply a change to a level.
 *
 *  Instead of failing out when two different operations are applied,
 *  I could instead resolve the conflict by accumulating lower-bounds
 *  separately from increments and always applying lower-bounds first.
 *  That would resolve the conflict, but it might produce a somewhat
 *  unintuitive result for the user.  I've chosen this route because
 *  at least the behavior is obvious (and I can't think of any use
 *  case for actually merging lower-bounds and increments).
